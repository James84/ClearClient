Clear client allows you to make http calls using http client found in .NET 4.5 in a quick and easy way.

To get started add a reference to the ClearClient library and then to create a GenericClient object; this will set up the HttpClient behind the scenes:

	GenericClient client = new GenericClient("base url");

If you need to use basic authentication you can do this too by simply wacking in the username and password after the url in the constructor like this:

	GenericClient client = new GenericClient("<base url>", "<username>", "<password>");

To make an Http request there are a number of methods you can use:

	Get<T>:
		If you wish to deserialize the response into an object you can use the generic Get<T> method:
		
			var response = client.Get<object>("<url/query params>");
			
		This will return the response in the object of your choice.
	
	GetJson:
		If you simply want to return a Json string use GetJson:
		
			var response = client.GetJson("<url/query params>");
			
	GetXML:
		If you want the response in XML call GetXML:
			var response = client.GetXML("<url/query params>");
			
	Async methods:
	All of the above methods also have an an asynchronous counterpart which utilises the new async features of .NET 4.5:
	
		GetAsync<T>
		GetJsonAsync
		GetXmlAsync
		
	These all return a Task which can be awaited using the await keyword for asynchronous programming:
		var response = await client.GetAsync<object>("search?keywords=developer");
